Bismark-MethylDackel pipeline in snakemake.

## Reproducible pipeline

This pipeline guarantees reproducible results, which means that it guarantees same output (DNA methylation levels) with same input (Bisulfite sequencing reads). The reproducibility is continuously being tested and the result is shown as a badge above.
